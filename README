This is my version of the Schulte table, in which there is nothing superfluous.
I build it with Unity.

Schulte tables are tables with randomly arranged characters, usually numbers or letters used to check and develop the speed of their visual search in a specific order.
These tables were originally developed by the German psychotherapist Walter Schulte as a psychodiagnostic test for studying the properties of attention.
Later they began to be used as exercises for training peripheral visual perception, which is useful for developing the speed reading skill. In addition,
these tables are used in psychology (there are various methods) in studying the effectiveness and efficiency of people, their ability to hold and switch attention.
